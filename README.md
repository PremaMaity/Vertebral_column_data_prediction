# Vertebral_column_data_prediction
Data set containing values of biomechanical features used to classify orthopedic patients into 2 classes (normal or abnormal)
It is a beginner level EDA and building model with logistic Regression>=>SVM> KNN >Radom Forest>naive bayes> Desicison tree
Checked that there no missing and null values present in the data set
With the help of matplotlin and seaborn library tried to plot different graphs and tried analyze the relationship between different features
Compare the accuracy of each model followed with The highest accuracy is with logistic Regression>=>SVM> KNN >Radom Forest>naive bayes> Desicison tree
